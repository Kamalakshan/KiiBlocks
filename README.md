# KiiBlocks

## About this project
This project is designed to be a fully operational, open-source game for iOS based on the SpriteKit framework introduced in iOS7. 

Follow the videos below if it's your first time getting into SpriteKit for a full tutorial, or dive right into the code.

The game utilizes [Kii Cloud](http://en.kii.com/develop/mobile-backend/) for user management, leaderboard and game analytics.


## Video Tutorials
There is an ongoing video series dedicated to the development of this project, aimed to teach about SpriteKit, Kii Cloud and general iOS game development. If you're new to SpriteKit, start at the beginning - or jump around to what looks most relevant to you.

Each tutorial will have a tag in this Github project's **Releases** section so you can pull the exact code snapshot relevant to that tutorial without having to sift through the entire game. 

### Part 1: Getting started with SpriteKit
The first part in a video series for building an iOS game using SpriteKit and Kii Cloud. This installment will show how to create a SpriteKit project and test out the built-in physics engine.

Relevant code is under the tag **tutorial-1** located [here](https://github.com/KiiPlatform/KiiBlocks/releases/tag/tutorial-1)
